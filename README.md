hi we have created a basic network sniffer in python using scapy module, scapy is powerful for packet manipulation, detecting open ports and running services typically requires higher-level protocols such as TCP or UDP.
This code will print out TCP and UDP packets along with their source and destination ports. However, determining running services based solely on packet capture might require more sophisticated analysis, such as examining application layer protocols like HTTP, FTP, etc., and inspecting payloads for service identification. This can get complex quickly and might not always be reliable due to encryption or other factors.
